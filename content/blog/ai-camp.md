## Problem
The inaugural AI Camp presented the task of pose classification to students from Junior Colleges, Polytechnics, and Universities. 

A week prior to the start of the camp, participants were given basic training on deep learning methods for image classification, and a training and validation set of 11 poses were released. The participants had one week to come up with their own methods to perform the pose classification. On the first day of the camp, the participants were given a test set they had never encountered before to check the performance of their methods. Thereafter, a curveball was released to them with an additional four poses to classify. The participants were given another test set to evaluate the performance of their methods on all 15 classes. Finally, the camp was rounded off with an evaluation against a final test set. The finalists were chosen based on the teams' performances on the final test set. The finishing order for the finalists was eventually decided after the finalists presented their methods in a pitch to the judges.
